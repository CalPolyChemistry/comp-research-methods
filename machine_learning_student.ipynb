A best practice is to set a random state when comparing models, but to not use a random state for a model that is going into production.

    "In order to evaluate the performance of our model, we can first create a dummy \"model\" using the ``DummyRegressor`` class from the ``sklearn.dummy`` module. This class provides a simple way to create a model that calculates the mean value of the target feature and predicts this mean value for each observation. The ``fit`` method is used to train the model on the training data. Once the model is trained, we can use the ``predict`` method to make predictions on the test data. Note that the ``DummyRegressor`` is not for solving real problems! The value of the ``DummyRegressor`` is to provide a baseline set of values for the evaluating the error (such as mean squared error or R-squared). An true machine learning model trained with the same data should have much better performance than the ``DummyRegressor``."

    "### What is a random forest model?\n",
    "There are many other kinds of machine learning models besides linear regression models.  One type is \n",
    "a random forest regression model. A random forest is a decision tree model that uses a \"forest\" of multiple decision trees and randomly chooses which variables to use in each tree. Generally, each individual tree is not that good at making a prediction, but collectively the trees are quite good at making predictions. Note that each tree predicts an individual value and then a vote is taken (in the case of regression, an average of the predicted values) to determine the final predicted value.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "Random forest models (and many other models) have hyperparameters that can be 'tuned' to opmitize model performance.The number of trees (``n_iterators``) can be specified, with a default value of 100 trees. Each tree also has a depth(``max_depth``) which specifies the maximum number of splits a tree can have, with the default value being no limit on the depth ('None'). Too few trees or trees that are too shallow results in a model that predicts poorly due to underfitting the data--the model is too simple to predict using train or test data. Too many trees or trees that are too deep results in a model that predicts poorly due to overfitting the data--the model is so complex it can predict using the original data extremely well but cannot predict using new data. The default values are a good starting place for most random forest models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building and training a default random forest regression model\n",
    "We will first build and train a random forest model that uses the default parameters. We will use the ``RandomForestRegressor`` class from the ``sklearn.ensemble`` module to create the model. "

    "### What is a classification model?\n",
    "Classification models predict classes rather than a range of values. Classification models are very popular in many situations because the predictions are easy to understand.  A model that take an image and predicts if it is a dog or a cat is a popular example of a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data we have been working with, predicting if a compound is soluble or insoluble in water would be a relevant classification model. The model could predict \"insoluble\" versus \"soluble\", instead of predicting the numerical value of `logS`.  It is possible to build a multi-class classifier model with more than two classes, but these are more complex to build than a binary (two class) model. We will focus on a binary classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the binary target\n",
    "In order to predict a binary target, we need our data set to have a categorical variable as one of the features. This is a variable with only categories, or classes, even if those classes are represented as numbers. We added a column to our original dataframe called \"soluble\", one that labeled each molecule as either insoluble (0) or soluble (1). This will be the target variable for building our classification model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics for classification models\n",
    "We have been using RMSE and R2 values, but these are not useful for classification models. Instead we will use the ``sklearn.metrics`` functions for ``accuracy_score``, ``precision_score`` and ``recall_score``. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Accuracy</b> measures the correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. This is useful, but can be misleading if the data set has much more of one class over the other. For example, if toxic molecules are only 1% of an entire data set the accuracy would be 0.99 even if every toxic molecule was incorrectly classified as non-toxic. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Precision</b> measures how many negative values are falsely labeled as positive. This is an important metric if the cost of a false positive is high, for example incorrectly identifying a molecule as toxic and removing it from a list of potential drug candidates. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Recall</b> measures the ability to find all positives and is important when the cost of false negatives is high, for example predicting that a compound is non-toxic when it is actually toxic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently all three metrics are evaluated for classification models. Note that precision and recall are often inversely related, and so you may need to find a compromise between the two when building a classification a model. There are many other ``sklearn.metrics`` for classification models, which you can explore on the scikitlearn website.\n"
